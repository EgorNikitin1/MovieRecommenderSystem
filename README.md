# Movie Recommender System
This service helps users find interesting movies based on their preferences. The CountVectorizer algorithm from the scikit-learn library is used as the basis for recommendations. The data for model development is obtained from an extensive dataset on the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata). The user interface is based on the FastAPI web framework.
